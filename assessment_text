Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to boost productivity and growth, but its impact on economies and 
societies is uncertain, varying by job roles and sectors, with the potential to amplify disparities. As a 
positive productivity shock, AI will expand economies’ production frontiers and will lead to reallocations 
between labor and capital while triggering potentially profound changes in many jobs and sectors. AI offers 
unprecedented opportunities for solving complex problems and improving the accuracy of predictions, 
enhancing decision-making, boosting economic growth, and improving lives. However, precisely because of its 
vast and flexible applicability in numerous domains, the implications for economies and societies are uncertain 
(Ilzetzki and Jain 2023). 
AI represents a wide spectrum of technologies designed to enable machines to perceive, interpret, act, 
and learn with the intent to emulate human cognitive abilities. Across this spectrum, generative AI (GenAI) 
includes systems such as sophisticated large language models that can create new content, ranging from text 
to images, by learning from extensive training data. Other AI models, in contrast, are more specialized, 
focusing on discrete tasks such as pattern identification. Meanwhile, automation is characterized by its focus on 
optimizing repetitive tasks to boost productivity, rather than producing new content. The field of AI is 
experiencing a swift evolution, especially with the advent of GenAI, which has broadened AI's potential 
applications. This suggests that its impact will expand to reshape job functions and the division of labor. 
One critical dimension to consider is the societal acceptability of AI. Acceptability may vary depending on 
job roles. Some professions may seamlessly integrate AI tools, while others could face resistance because of 
cultural, ethical, or operational concerns. This uncertainty becomes especially pronounced in labor markets. 
Although AI holds the potential for production-oriented applications, its effect will likely be mixed. In some 
sectors where human oversight of AI is necessary, it could amplify worker productivity and labor demand. 
Conversely, in other sectors, AI might pave the way for significant job displacements. A rise in aggregate 
productivity of the economy could however strengthen overall economic demand, potentially creating more job 
opportunities for most workers in a ripple effect. Moreover, this evolution could also lead to the emergence of 
new sectors and job roles—and the disappearance of others—transcending mere intersectoral reallocation.
